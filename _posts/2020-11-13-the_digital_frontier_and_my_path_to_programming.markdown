Typical afternoon in the Carolina's. Warm summer day with a cool breeze flowing through the open windows. There I was, typing away on my computer. Audio files passing information through alternating electrical currents, traveling at wicked speeds through a cable and out to the buds of my headphones. In the middle of creating a new "old skool" playlist for skateboarding on spotify, I was nearly finished when BAM it happens.

My screen completely froze. Next there was a high-pitched ring emitting through my speakers, along with a black and 
yellow message that appeared on my screen. "WARNING! Virus Invasion Detected!Infected files found: 22,000,
Common threats detected: 50 â€” CALL VIRUS REMOVAL TECH SUPPORT NOW. 1 (877) 440-6222". Locked out of my
computer, without hesitation I dialed that number. Speaking nervously over the phone I explained the error message on my computer, how I was locked out, and the number of viruses detected. Very calmly, the person on the other line talked me through unlocking my computer, installing a program that would help them have remote access, and the steps it would take to clean my computer. Taking remote access they proceeded to read through my files and explained to me I had a major Trojan installed and that they needed to remove it before any major damage could occur. They gave me the length of time it would take, and how much it would cost. Not knowing a thing about the security of computers and today's cyberwar, I agreed, completely oblivious to the unforeseen threat unfolding.

A few hours go by, I log back onto my computer to find everything was fixed. Or so I thought. I contacted my grandfather who had years of experience in IT and told him what happen. He then questioned the integrity of the so-called IT Company that contacted me. Asking if I knew for sure they were who they said they were. Not able to answer his questions he encouraged me to take my lap top to a professional. Well, my uncle worked in the security side of IT, so I brought my wounded laptop to his house. About 40 minutes into his investigation he concluded that the people who contacted me were the ones who installed the virus in the first place, and part of the con was to have me call them with my account information. Not only that, but they also embedded a virus within my system that would allow them to take remote access whenever, wherever, along with a Key logger to record every password, surname, account information they could grab. Complete disbelief. I then tried to contact them with the original phone number, and the phone company said that the number was no longer in service. So, without hesitation I contacted my bank, closed all my accounts, then proceeded to file a claim with my bank. Turns out there were similar attacks within my county at that time. It was a very stressful and frustrating episode to go through to say the least.

I was able to get my money back, fix my computer to its original state, and upgraded by firewalls. Although I was quite upset with the whole ordeal, I was actually impressed by the simple, yet intrinsic design of the attack. Everything from the social engineering, the cyber reconnaissance, execution of the virus, and then the Key logger to maintain complete control without me ever knowing was incredibly clever.

Thus, my love for computer science began. After researching the specific attack the hackers used, I then researched how to better protect my system from future attacks. Understanding the importance to having a solid security system installed and daily scanning for potential threats in vital in today's IT world. Learning how to protect one self is only one way to view IT security. Shifting perspectives I wanted to view the world of Cyber Security in the eyes of the attacker. Once I had the fundamentals of the computer system, I then moved into understanding how network protocols work and how to exploit them. Then I jumped into the world of Linux to view the computers files system at its most basic form. With months and months of self-study, long nights researching security concepts and technologies, hours installing Kali Linux and learning every type of exploiting attack, crack, and hack I was set on pursuing a career in Cyber Security.

***The shift of perspective:***


It wasn't until I sat down at my desk and viewed my programs, tabs, windows and thought to my self "I know how to right click this page, view the page source and figure a way to break a password or find some other information, but I don't even understand the core properties of why this is, the way it is". So I took a break from my studies and began learning the core basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I found it to be absolutely fascinating. From the creation side, to the engineering behind it all, I was in love. That's when I enrolled in Flatirons Intro To Programming curriculum, and for about a year I just continued learning more and more about web design until finally I decided to take it to the next level and pursue a career in computer programming! Computer programming taught me that life is nothing more then a complex, yet structured program. It runs smooth, and of course, with anything has its own problems that need debugging but that's what makes it exciting.
